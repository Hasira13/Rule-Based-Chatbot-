# Rule-Based-Chatbot-
A simple chatbot built in Python that responds to user queries using predefined rules and if-else logic. This project demonstrates the basics of natural language processing (NLP) and conversation flow without using machine learning.
Features

Responds to common greetings and questions

Uses rule-based matching (if-else / keyword matching)

Lightweight and beginner-friendly

Easy to extend with new rules

Getting Started

Clone the Repository git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-based-chatbot.git cd rule-based-chatbot

Run the Chatbot python chatbot.py

Example Interaction User: hi
Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?

User: what is your name?
Bot: I am a simple rule-based chatbot.

User: bye
Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!

How It Works

The chatbot checks user input against predefined rules.

If a match is found, it returns the corresponding response.

If no rule matches, it replies with a fallback message (e.g., "Sorry, I donâ€™t understand.").

Future Improvements

Add more rules for better coverage

Use regex for pattern matching

Add a GUI or web-based interface
